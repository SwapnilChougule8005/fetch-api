        info: `Further information: Bade Baba temple
        There is a large statue of Rishabhanatha (also known as "Bade Baba" and "Adinath") on top of the hill in Kundalpur. The statue, seated in the lotus position, is 15 feet in height and is on a 3-foot high pedestal.[7] It is flanked on both sides by Parshvanatha images of the same height. The statue was incorrectly identified in 1878 by Joseph David Beglar, who noted the inscription mounted on the wall, as of Neminatha.[3] The statue was again incorrectly identified in 1884 by Alexander Cunningham as an image of Mahavira.[1] Niraj Jain established that the statue is in fact of Rishabhanatha.[8] This is also the place of salvation of the last Kevali, named Shridhar Kevali.[9] Photographs of the Bade Baba statue have been widely used in many publications, calendars, and posters.
        
        Among all the temples of Kundalpur, the most famous is the Bade Baba temple, with Rishabhanatha (affectionately termed "Bade Baba") as the principal deity. Another temple — called Jal Mandir — is situated in the middle of Vardhamana pond, at the foot of the hill. A Samosharana temple was built that commemorated the 25th anniversary of the parinirvana of Lord Mahavira in 1974. A manastambha in the center of the dharmashala was constructed in 1975.`,

        info: `Ram Temple is an important Hindu temple currently under construction in Ayodhya , Uttar Pradesh , India . In January 2024, its sanctum sanctorum and first floor were ready and on 22 January 2024, the idol in the child form of Shri Ram was consecrated in it.

        This temple is situated at the place which is considered to be the birthplace of Ram, the main deity of Hindu religion . [4] [5] Earlier, the site housed the Babri Masjid, which was constructed after demolishing an existing un-Islamic structure, which was later demolished. [6] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled on the disputed land , stating that the land belongs to Hindus and a Ram temple can be built on it. Muslims will be given a separate piece of land to build a mosque. [7] The court cited as evidence a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which cited evidence suggesting the presence of a non-Islamic structure beneath the demolished Babri Mosque. [8]
        
        Bhoomipujan to begin the construction of Ram temple was performed on 5 August 2020. [9] The temple currently under construction is being maintained by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The inauguration of the temple is scheduled for 22 January 2024. [10]
        
        
        The temple has been embroiled in several controversies due to alleged misuse of donations, sidelining of its key workers and politicization of the temple by the BJP`,

        info: `Archaeological evidences indicate the presence of Jains going back to at least 1500 BCE. The earliest literary reference to Shikharji as a tirth (place of pilgrimage) is found in the Jñātṛdhārmakātha, one of the twelve core texts of Jainism compiled in 6th century BCE by chief disciple of Mahavira. Shikharji is also mentioned in the Pārśvanāthacarita, a twelfth-century biography of Pārśva. A 13th century CE palm-leaf manuscript of Kalpa Sūtra and Kalakacaryakatha has an image of a scene of Parshavanatha's nirvana at Shikharji.[14]

        Modern history records show that Shikharji Hill is regarded as the place of worship of the Jain community. Vastupala, prime minister during the reign of king Vīradhavala and Vīsaladeva of Vaghela dynasty, constructed a Jain temple housing 20 idols of Tirthankaras.[15] The temple also housed images of his ancestors and Samavasarana.[16] During the regime of Mughal's rule in India, Emperor Akbar in the year 1583 had passed an firman (official order) granting the management of Shikharji Hill to the Jain community to prevent the slaughter of animals in the vicinity.[17][18] Seth Hiranand Mukim, personal jeweller of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, lead a party from Agra to Shikharji for Jain pilgrimage.[19] In 2019, the Government of Delhi included Sammed Shikharji under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana`,
